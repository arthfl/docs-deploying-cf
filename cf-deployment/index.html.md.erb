title: Deploying Cloud Foundry with cf-deployment
owner: Release Integration
---

This topic describes how to deploy Cloud Foundry
using `cf-deployment`. For more information about `cf-deployment`, see the [`cf-deployment` repository](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment) on GitHub.

##<a id='overview'></a> Overview

`cf-deployment` relies on individual component releases and prioritizes the following:

* Readability for a human operator -
  `cf-deployment` includes only necessary configuration
* Security and production-readiness by default
* Native use of [Diego](../../concepts/diego/diego-architecture.html)
  and lack of support for [Droplet Execution Agents](../../concepts/architecture/execution-agent.html)

###<a id='prepare'></a> Prepare Your Environment

Before deploying Cloud Foundry with `cf-deployment`,
you must prepare your environment
and deploy a BOSH Director.

The procedures vary depending on your IaaS.

The following IaaSes have been tested and found to be compatible with Cloud Foundry:

* AWS 
* Azure
* Bosh-lite
* GCP
* Openstack
* Vsphere
* AliCloud
* Softlayer

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: All other IaaSes have not been tested with Cloud Foundry. Attempts to deploy Cloud Foundry against untested IaaSes may fail.</p>


Select the topic specific to your IaaS:

* [Deploying BOSH on AWS](../common/aws.html)
* [Deploying BOSH on GCP](gcp.html)

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>:
The topics for preparing your environment
use the bosh-bootloader tool.
bosh-bootloader is currently only compatible
with Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
and Amazon Web Services (AWS).</p>

###<a id='deploy'></a> Deploy Cloud Foundry

After preparing your environment
and deploying a BOSH Director,
continue to the [Deploying Cloud Foundry](deploy-cf.html) topic.
